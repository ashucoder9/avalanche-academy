Issues to fix:


1. Bring all existing course content into the course folder and make sure nothing looks offbeat.
2. Migrate to FlexSearch, ditch Algolia
3. Once this is done, get access of original avalanche academy repo and push changes there.
4. Blog can be removed (but we can use it for posting long-form technical tutorials fyi)
