Issues to fix:

Top Priority: customize the homepage to present different courses and remove anything unnecessary

1. Bring all existing course content into the course folder and make sure nothing looks offbeat
2. Migrate to FlexSearch, ditch Algolia
3. Once this is done, get access of original avalanche academy repo and push changes
4. Blog can be removed (but we can use it for posting long-form technical tutorials fyi)
5. Create a proper README which demonstrates how to make contributions to this repo
6. Rebuild Blog according to our needs


## Course Migration Status: (only lists what is done)

Avalanche Fundamentals:
- Welcome complete (except telegram chat link)
- Primer (skipped demo, whitepaper, learning checklist)
-
