## Local Files

You can store documents locally in the `content` folder.

For advanced usages, you may directly interact with the output configuration.

Read the [Files Section](https://contentlayer.dev/docs/sources/files) on their documentation
to learn more about local source.

```ts
import { createConfig } from "fumadocs-contentlayer/configuration";
import { makeSource } from 'contentlayer/source-files';

const config = createConfig({ ... })

export default makeSource(config)
```

## Remote Files

Assume your files are stored in a remote Git repository, Contentlayer supports
remote sources which acts very similar to Files source.

You can see the examples in
[their docs](https://contentlayer.dev/docs/sources/remote-files).

```ts
const config = createConfig({ ... })

export default makeSource({
    syncFiles: syncContentFromGit,
    ...config
})
```
