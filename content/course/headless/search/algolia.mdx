<Callout title="Notice">
  If you're using Algolia's free tier, you have to [display their logo on your
  search dialog](https://algolia.com/policies/free-services-terms).

## Indexing

The default behavior creates a record for each paragraph in your document, it is
officially recommended by Algolia.

Each record contains searchable attributes `title`, `section`, and `content`.
`section` is optional, it only exists in paragraphs under a heading. Headings and
paragraphs are all indexed as an individual record, grouped by their `page_id`.

## Setup

<div className='steps'>

<div className='step'>

Install `algoliasearch`

```package-install
algoliasearch
```

</div>

<div className="step">
  Sign up and obtain the required API keys for your search. Store these
  credentials in environment variables.
</div>

<div className='step'>

Create and sync your indexes with the `sync` function.

```js title="update-index.mjs"
import algosearch from 'algoliasearch'
import { sync } from 'fumadocs-core/search-algolia/server'
import { structure } from 'fumadocs-core/mdx-plugins'

const client = algosearch(...)

sync(client, {
  documents: indexes // [!code highlight]
})
```

The `indexes` variable should be provided by your content source provider. If you are using Fumadocs MDX, see [Search Index Generation](/docs/mdx/search-index).

Notably, it requires a `structured` property, this can be obtained from [structurize](/docs/headless/mdx/structure), or sometimes supplied by the content source you are using.

You may make it a script and manually sync with `node ./update-index.mjs`, or
integrate it with your CI/CD pipeline.

> Notice that it expects the `url` property of a page to be unique. In other words, you shouldn't have two pages with the same
> url.

<Callout type="warn" title="Typescript Usage">
  If you are running the script with
  [TSX](https://github.com/privatenumber/tsx) or other similar Typescript
  executors, ensure to name it `.mts` for best ESM compatibility.
</Callout>
   
</div>

<div className='step'>

To search documents on the client side, you can use the [Fumadocs UI Search Dialog](/docs/ui/search#algolia), or bring your own implementation.

In addition, the `useAlgoliaSearch` hook can handle state management with SWR.

```ts
import { useAlgoliaSearch } from 'fumadocs-core/search-algolia/client'

const index = algoliasearch(...).initIndex('document')

const { search, setSearch, query } = useAlgoliaSearch(index, {
   distinct: 5,
   hitsPerPage: 10
})
```

</div>
</div>

### Customise Attributes & Settings

While the default attributes might not suit your case, you can pass `extra_data`
to index options for adding extra fields to each record.

```js
sync(client, {
  documents: allDocs.map(docs => ({
    ...,
    extra_data: {
      tag: docs.tag
    }
  }))
})
```

To customize the default index settings, set index settings, and update
documents with `updateDocuments(...)` separately.
