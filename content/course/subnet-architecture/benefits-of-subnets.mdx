## Compliance Options

The C-Chain is open and permissionless, meaning anyone can deploy and interact with contracts. However, for regulatory reasons, some applications may need a consistent access control mechanism for all on-chain transactions. We can configure Subnets so that only authorized users may deploy contracts or issue transactions.

## Independent Tokenomics

Avalanche Subnets can have any token as their gas token. One result of this is that surging gas prices on other chains, such as Ethereum or the C-Chain, won't affect the Subnet.

## Private Blockchains

Public blockchains offer full transaction transparency. This may not suit business scenarios needing confidentiality. Private blockchains limit transaction visibility to a select group, with controlled permissions and the option for transaction encryption. This ensures that sensitive data isn't publicly accessible, and that specific data can be hidden, revealed only on a need-to-know basis.

## Flexibility with Virtual Machines

Traditional blockchain networks, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, have a single virtual machine. The blockchains of a Subnet can be instances of different VMs. It is easy to use existing VMs, such as the subnetEVM, or create a new custom VM. This flexible architecture leads to network effects on the individual blockchains and compound network effects between Subnets and blockchains.
