Are you ready to dive deeper into the fascinating world of Avalanche? This course will equip you with a comprehensive understanding of the Avalanche's Subnet architecture, along with the practical skills required to create and manage Subnets.

Ideal for people familiar with the basics of Avalanche, this course will unlock the potential of creating Subnets. We will explore the various components and key concepts of the Subnet architecture, empowering you to fully leverage its benefits.

Throughout this course, you will gain hands-on experience by utilizing the Avalanche Command Line Interface (Avalanche CLI) to create your own Subnets and run them locally. You will explore different variations and configurations to learn the versatility and advantages of Subnets. Additionally, you will interact with the local instances using the Core Wallet, further enhancing your practical skills.

Let's get started exploring the power of Subnets.

## Prerequisites

1. This course is for people who understand the Avalanche basics. If you are not familiar with Avalanche Consensus, Virtual Machines, blockchains in Avalanche, or Subnets, we strongly recommend taking our Avalanche Fundamentals course first.

2. You should have Core Wallet browser extension installed and know how to send funds, as well as change between networks and accounts.

3. You should have a general understanding the EVM and basic Solidity smart contracts, including deploying them via Remix using Core as the injected provider.

## Learning Outcome

In this course you will learn:

- The benefits of Subnets
- How to use Avalanche CLI to create and run Subnets locally
- How to interact with Subnets using Core Wallet
